        <p>Dhaka International University has received an international recognition (Observer Status) from the
            United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Countries who have attained the
            status can join the UNFCCC meet to measure progress and negotiate multilateral responses to climate
            change.</p>
            <p>The UNFCCC is a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992 – shortly after the first assessment report by the
              Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 – to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations
              "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate
              system.” At present, there are 198 Parties to the Convention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since entering into force in 1994, the UNFCCC has provided the basis for international climate negotiations,
              including landmark agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement (2015).

                <h4>Why Climate Change?</h4>
                <p>
                  Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be
                  natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human
                  activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like
                  coal, oil and gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global
                  temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a
                  livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 3°C temperature rise by the end of the century,
                  which will be undoubtedly a catastrophe to the scale human tolerance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some
                  countries produce much more than others. The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of
                  America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about
                  half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater
                  responsibility to act first. As a part of this DIU is committed to take climate action, the mission of the
                  university is to produce capable leaders in the respective field of study who can meet the challenges ofpresent dynamic world and the vision of DIU is to contribute to the nation by producing age-worthy,
                  pragmatic and eligible graduates through continual innovation in education and research. To meet
                  successful mission and vision DIU is continuously working on community engagement issues especially
                  climate change. For legal recognition DIU had applied on 27 August 2022, finally on 01 December 2023,
                  DIU has received the final recognition from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
                  (UNFCCC). DIU is very delighted to receive this international recognition and appreciates the team climate
                  change. DIU believes that it will be the inspiration for working on climate action.

                  We are happy to share that DIU organized several pre-cop sessions in-collaboration with OXFAM
                  Bangladesh, and Climate Parliament, Earth Foundation, and UNDP on 11 November, and 17 & 18
                  November 2023 respectively. Pulling together the findings from these sessions with representatives from
                  the government, civil society and academia, DIU is going to organize a COP side event on 10 December
                  2023 at Bangladesh pavilion on “ Equity and Just Transition: Bangladesh Insights at COP 28” at the
                  United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) in Dubai, UAE.
