      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Tobacco use is the most serious worldwide public health challenge. Medical science
        clearly recognizes tobacco as the single most significant cause of mortality and
        morbidity across the globe. It has assumed the dimension of an epidemic resulting in
        enormous disability, disease and death. In addition to disease burden, tobacco use results
        in severe social, economic and environmental burdens. Tobacco and related industries
        have been employing sustained tactics to attract new generations of tobacco users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Honourable Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina while speaking in the
        South Asian speakers’ summit in Dhaka in 2016 declared, inter alia, “My government
        will take all possible measures for effective implementation of existing tobacco control
        laws and in turn we will make our laws fully compliant with FCTC in line with our
        national priorities to achieve SDGs”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest national survey (GATS 2017) showed that 35.3% (37.8 million) of adults over
        15 years in Bangladesh currently use tobacco. Tobacco is the direct cause of over
        126,000 deaths every year in Bangladesh (13.5% of ALL deaths from any cause, Health
        cost study 2018). According to Tobacco Atlas 2020, total death was recorded as 161,253.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently about 1.5 million adults suffering from tobacco-attributable illness
        in Bangladesh, and more than 61,000 children (below age 15) are suffering from
        diseases caused by exposure to secondhand smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death and disease caused by tobacco has an economic impact as well.
        Smoking-attributable Health Expenditure (direct healthcare costs attributable to
        tobacco) in Bangladesh is estimated to be BDT 83.9 billion annually, 76% of which
        was paid by tobacco users’ households and 24% was financed through the public health
        sector budget, representing nearly 9% of total government health expenditure in the
        fiscal year 2018-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bangladesh has been conscious of the harmful effects of tobacco use and the efforts of
        the tobacco industries to attract new, young users. Bangladesh was one of the founding
        signatory Parties of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO
        FCTC), the first coordinated global effort to reduce tobacco use. Bangladesh signing the
        treaty on 16 June 2003 and ratifying it on 14 June 2004. The WHO FCTC then entered
        into force on February 27, 2005. The treaty requires Parties to implement
        evidence-based measures to reduce tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. When
        effectively implemented, the WHO FCTC is a fundamental tool to reduce the
        devastating global consequences of tobacco products on health, lives, economies and
        environments. With 182 Parties as of May 2020, the WHO FCTC is one of the most
        widely adopted treaties in the United Nations system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bangladesh followed this by adopting The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products
        (Control) Act 2005, (SUTPCA 2005) which was further updated in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Act, together with its implementing Rules, bans smoking in some public places, the
        sale of tobacco products to minors, and most direct and indirect advertising of tobacco
        and tobacco use. The Act also specifies the mandatory display of pictorial health
        warning on tobacco packs.
