      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Tobacco use is the most serious worldwide public health challenge. Medical science
        clearly recognizes tobacco as the single most significant cause of mortality and
        morbidity across the globe. It has assumed the dimension of an epidemic resulting in
        enormous disability, disease and death. In addition to disease burden, tobacco use results
        in severe social, economic and environmental burdens. Tobacco and related industries
        have been employing sustained tactics to attract new generations of tobacco users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Honourable Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina while speaking in the
        South Asian speakers’ summit in Dhaka in 2016 declared, inter alia, “My government
        will take all possible measures for effective implementation of existing tobacco control
        laws and in turn we will make our laws fully compliant with FCTC in line with our
        national priorities to achieve SDGs”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest national survey (GATS 2017) showed that 35.3% (37.8 million) of adults over
        15 years in Bangladesh currently use tobacco. Tobacco is the direct cause of over
        126,000 deaths every year in Bangladesh (13.5% of ALL deaths from any cause, Health
        cost study 2018). According to Tobacco Atlas 2020, total death was recorded as 161,253.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently about 1.5 million adults suffering from tobacco-attributable illness
        in Bangladesh, and more than 61,000 children (below age 15) are suffering from
        diseases caused by exposure to secondhand smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death and disease caused by tobacco has an economic impact as well.
        Smoking-attributable Health Expenditure (direct healthcare costs attributable to
        tobacco) in Bangladesh is estimated to be BDT 83.9 billion annually, 76% of which
        was paid by tobacco users’ households and 24% was financed through the public health
        sector budget, representing nearly 9% of total government health expenditure in the
        fiscal year 2018-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bangladesh has been conscious of the harmful effects of tobacco use and the efforts of
        the tobacco industries to attract new, young users. Bangladesh was one of the founding
        signatory Parties of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO
        FCTC), the first coordinated global effort to reduce tobacco use. Bangladesh signing the
        treaty on 16 June 2003 and ratifying it on 14 June 2004. The WHO FCTC then entered
        into force on February 27, 2005. The treaty requires Parties to implement
        evidence-based measures to reduce tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. When
        effectively implemented, the WHO FCTC is a fundamental tool to reduce the
        devastating global consequences of tobacco products on health, lives, economies and
        environments. With 182 Parties as of May 2020, the WHO FCTC is one of the most
        widely adopted treaties in the United Nations system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bangladesh followed this by adopting The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products
        (Control) Act 2005, (SUTPCA 2005) which was further updated in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Act, together with its implementing Rules, bans smoking in some public places, the
        sale of tobacco products to minors, and most direct and indirect advertising of tobacco
        and tobacco use. The Act also specifies the mandatory display of pictorial health
        warning on tobacco packs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the Act is intended as a comprehensive law on tobacco control, it was adopted
        over 16 years ago. The 2013 update was still some 8 years ago. Global practice has
        developed and moved on since then and Bangladesh’s law is in urgent need of updating.
        With the passage of time and a greater understanding of the full range of measures
        necessary to combat the tobacco epidemic, lacunas in the Act have become apparent and
        proved to be a major challenge in its effective implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        These gaps in the current law are highlighted by the WHO Report on the Global
        Tobacco Epidemic (GTCR) 2021, which provides the status of countries’
        implementation of key tobacco control measures. Bangladesh has adopted best practices
        in Monitoring and Health Warnings on packs. In all other policy areas, Bangladesh falls
        into the “Moderate” or “Low” category, of adoption and implementation with no
        forward progress since 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bangladesh continues to allow Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) in many public
        places, restaurants with more than one room, work places and public transport. The
        WHO FCTC and all the research evidence is clear that DSAs, ventilation systems, air
        exchanges, and filtration devices – are not protective, and cannot eliminate all
        second-hand smoke. In addition, the compliance and enforcement of smoke-free laws in
        Bangladesh is reported to be poor. It is imperative for Bangladesh to remove all
        provisions for DSAs in its law and takes steps to effectively enforce smoke-free rules in
        all public places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Bangladesh is compliant with the WHO FCTC obligations for mandating
        50% pictorial health warnings, this now falls far behind in terms of global best practice
        where countries are requiring greater than 75% health warnings along with plain
        packaging for tobacco products. Pictorial health warnings size in Nepal (at 90%), India
        and Thailand (at 85%), and Sri Lanka (at 80%).
      </p>
      <p>
        Advertising continues to take place in Bangladesh by way of point-of-sale displays,
        sales on the internet, brand sharing and brand stretching, some sponsorship of events,
        and corporate responsibility programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sale of single sticks of cigarettes and bidis is an important factor that allows and
        encourages young people to start smoking. Banning this practice, as at least 75 other
        countries already have, is critical to reducing smoking initiation by youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, to improving the existing provision in the 2005 Act (as amended),
        Bangladesh now needs to face up to the threats to public health from new tobacco and
        nicotine products, such as electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco products (HTP) and oral
        nicotine pouches, which are becoming increasingly popular around the globe and are the
        tobacco industry’s latest way to addict the next generation of young people to nicotine.
        The tobacco industry is seeking to create a new image for itself by claiming these
        products are ‘reduced risk’ and can assist in fighting the harms of the tobacco epidemic.
        In reality, these new products are just the latest way for the industry to generate profits
        through addiction and to distract government’s attention away from effectively
        protecting public health
      </p>
      <h4>The WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2021, notes -</h4>
      <p class="pl-5">
        <strong>“As cigarette sales have fallen, tobacco companies have been aggressively
          marketing new products – like e-cigarettes and heated-tobacco products – and
          lobby governments to limit their regulation. Their goal is simple: to hook another
          generation on nicotine.”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vital that Bangladesh addresses the looming threat to public health from new
        tobacco and nicotine products by banning the products, before the industry is able to
        establish strong markets in Bangladesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        This report is intended as a comprehensive analysis of SUTPCA 2005, identifying the
        gaps in that law and proposing reforms which are in consonance with best practices
        adopted by other countries and the guidelines specified under the global public health
        treaty on tobacco control, World Health Organization Framework Convention on
        Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The recommendations in Part III of this report would
        ensure Bangladesh will have best practice in ‘Smoke-free’ and ‘Advertising bans’ and
        will come into line with global best practice in respect of packaging and health
        warnings, along with sales restrictions and the regulation of contents and emissions.
        Where a recommendation would impact the WHO analysis for the GTCR, this is
        highlighted in Part III.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effort to fulfil the obligations under the FCTC is aligned with the State`s primary
        duty of improving and protecting public health under the Constitution of Bangladesh.

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (control) Act, 2005 was amended in 2013
        to make it more compliant with WHO FCTC. Since then, about 8 years have passed. The
        last Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2017 report reveals that the prevalence of
        tobacco use in all forms among people (age 15 years and above) is still 35.3% (37.8
        million). Though it has reduced from 2009 (43.3) 1 . There are currently about 1.5 million
        adults suffering from tobacco-attributable illness in Bangladesh, and more than 61,000
        children (below age 15) are suffering from diseases caused by exposure to secondhand
        smoking. Deaths attributable to tobacco use are 161 thousand 2 while expenses for
        diseases and disabilities due to tobacco use was BDT 30,560 crore in 2018 3 . All public
        places are not 100% smoke-free in Bangladesh and ban on product display at points of
        sale is not specifically mentioned in the law. There is ambiguity in the provisions of the
        law relating to tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Meanwhile, emerging
        tobacco products like e-cigarettes have sprung up as a new threat to public health which
        were not incorporated in the above-mentioned tobacco control law of Bangladesh in
        2013 while amending the same. These gaps in the current tobacco control law are
        highlighted by the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic (GTCR) 2021 4 , which
        provides the status of countries’ implementation of key tobacco control measures.
        Bangladesh has adopted best practices in monitoring and health warnings on packs. In
        all other policy areas, Bangladesh falls into the “moderate” or “low” category of
        adoption and implementation with no forward progress since 2013. Global practice has
        developed and moved on since then and Bangladesh’s law is in urgent need of updating.
        With the passage of time and a greater understanding of the full range of measures
        necessary to combat the tobacco epidemic, lacunas in the Act have become apparent and
        proved to be a major challenge in its effective implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth mentioning in this context that Honourable Prime Minister of Bangladesh
        Sheikh Hasina while speaking in the South Asian Speakers’ Summit in Dhaka in 2016
        declared, inter alia, “My government will take all possible measures for effective
        implementation of existing tobacco control laws and in turn we will make our laws fully
        compliant with FCTC in line with our national priorities to achieve SDGs” 5 .

        In this backdrop, the government has initiated the process to further amend the Smoking
        and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control) Act, 2005 (amended in 2013) which is timely
        and commendable initiative and reflects the government’s commitment to protect public
        health from tobacco menace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a time, the study on “Tobacco Control Laws of Bangladesh: Analysis of Gaps
        and Proposed Reforms” has been undertaken by DIU with the intention of supporting
        the government’s initiative to amend the current tobacco control law with evidence in
        line with WHO FCTC and global best practices.
      </p>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        The study relied on secondary sources like, tobacco control laws of Bangladesh, WHO
        FCTC and its Guidelines, tobacco control laws of other countries, judicial decisions,
        parliamentary practices, expert consultation and content analysis. The study also
        examined the provisions of Bangladesh’s tobacco control law in relation to global best
        practices. A committee consisting of academicians, tobacco control advocates, lawyers
        and civil society members was formed by Dhaka International University to review the
        study report. Initial draft was reviewed by the committee and the researchers considered
        the feedbacks/comments and came up with the second draft. That was reviewed and
        further feedbacks/comments were provided to the researchers. Finally, they presented
        the final draft and the committee unanimously agreed to accept the report for publishing.
        The research was done between September 2020 to November 2021.
      </p>
      <h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Considering the short span of time and resource constraint, DIU opted for the analysis
        of gaps of the tobacco control laws of Bangladesh on the important areas in terms of
        WHO FCTC provisions since Bangladesh, as a signatory country of this international
        legal instrument, has incurred obligation to comply with its provisions. This study has
        specifically touched upon the areas of smoke-free environment, tobacco advertisement,
        promotion and sponsorship, size of Graphic health warning, single stick/loose sale and
        emerging tobacco products.

      </p>
      <p>
        It is agreed that there are scopes for numerous studies of this law in other perspectives
        as well. It is expected that more studies will be carried out in future by interested
        researchers and institutions to shed light on the gaps and lapse of the law in different
        perspectives. No uniform style of referencing has been followed.

      <h3 class="">1. The Burden of Tobacco in Bangladesh</h3>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.1. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Whether in rural or urban areas, people can be found throughout Bangladesh using
        different forms of tobacco (cigarettes, bidis, Zarda, gul) on the streets, in restaurants or
        on street side tea stalls. The feature of tobacco use in Bangladesh is that it is visible in
        varied degrees across the country irrespective of gender or residence (urban and rural).
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.2. Prevalence of tobacco use</h4>
      <h3>Types of tobacco and its use in Bangladesh</h3>
      <p>
        In most countries, cigarettes are the most prevalent form of smoking tobacco, but in
        Bangladesh tobacco use is multifarious. The common types of tobacco use are broadly
        divided into 1) smoking tobacco and 2) smokeless tobacco (SLT). The former includes
        manufactured cigarettes, bidis, hand-rolled cigarettes, pipes, cigars and water-pipes or
        hukkah, while the latter constitutes a variety of products including betel quid with zarda,
        zarda only, zarda with supari (Erica nut), betel quid with sada pata (dried leaf of
        tobacco), pan masala with tobacco, sada pata chewing, gul, khoinee and other SLT
        products but khoinee is rarely used.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have not been many studies on prevalence of tobacco use in Bangladesh. The
        Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2017 is a representative survey on the subject
        hence this report has been heavily relied upon to share data in this study. According to
        GATS 2017 Report, in Bangladesh

        4.5% students (5.9% of boys and 2.0% of girls) used smokeless tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Non communicable Disease (NCD) Risk Factor Survey 2018 conducted
        by NIPSOM of Bangladesh, overall 43.7% of adults (age 18 to 69 years) currently
        consumed tobacco in any form. Among them 59.6% were man and 28.3% woman.
        In NCD Risk Factor Survey 2010 it was overall 51.0% consumed tobacco in any form
        of tobacco, among them 70.0 % were man and 34.4% were woman. Of them 26.2 %
        were current smokers (54.8% man and 1.3% were woman). While 31.7% were overall
        SLT users (29.4% were men and 33.6% were woman).

      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.3. Exposure to Secondhand Smoke (SHS)</h4>
      <p>
        People in Bangladesh are victims of exposure to SHS also. In different studies it is
        evident that SHS is a serious public health concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to GYTS 2013, in Bangladesh overall 59.0% of young people are (61.3%
        boys and 54.8% girls) currently exposed to tobacco smoke inside any public place.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to GATS 2017 Report, 43.9% (38.4 m) non-smoker adults (age15 years and
        above) currently exposed to SHS at different public places, restaurants, indoor
        workplaces and public transports.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.4. Electronic Cigarette</h4>
      <p>
        Electronic nicotine delivery devices (ENDS) popularly known as electronic cigarettes
        are gradually making inroads in Bangladesh. Though GATS 2017 found that current
        users of electronic cigarettes were overall 0.2%, and men 0.5% while women 0.0%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the number of users of electronic cigarettes is low now, these devices are
        readily available. The teenagers and youth are the main victims. So, it is important to
        take control measure before further penetration in the society.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.5. Implementation status of the tobacco control laws</h4>
      <p>
        Compared to other crimes, smoking is considered frivolous and police forces are not
        inclined to enforce the relevant provisions of the Metropolitan Police Acts/Ordinances
        to punish smokers in certain places. The same applies to other authorities also. The
        Smoking and Tobacco Products Usage (Control) Act 2005 9 , as amended in 2013, proved
        to be more effective for tobacco control since it was the first legislation enacted
        exclusively for tobacco control and provided provisions complying largely with the
        FCTC Articles. After enactment of this law tobacco control activities gained momentum
        in collaboration with civil society organizations and NGOs. The awareness campaign,
        introduction of task forces at the field level for implementation of the law, operation of
        mobile courts and other administrative measures appear to be effective as is evident from different studies that
        tobacco consumption is in declining trend since introduction
        of the said Act in 2005.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.6. Data on death and disease caused by tobacco use in Bangladesh</h4>
      <p>
        A health cost study 2018 10 found that the people (age group 30 and above) of
        Bangladesh were exposed to tobacco related diseases as shown in Figure 2 below.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/img/publication/1.2.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;height:400px">
      <p>
        The report further reveals that 7 million people (aged 30 years and above) are suffering
        from tobacco-related diseases. Out of the 7 million, 1.5 million (22%) were attributable
        to tobacco use, while more than 435,000 children (below age 15) are falling prey to
        tobacco-related diseases. Notably, more than 61,000 (14%) of them are attributable to
        exposure to secondhand smoke at home.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.7. Deaths Due to Use of Tobacco</h4>
      <p>
        The use of tobacco poses serious risk of deaths and illnesses. A study from the WHO
        regional office for South-East Asia titled-Impact of tobacco related illnesses in
        Bangladesh, 2007 11 , estimated that there were as many as 57,000 tobacco-related deaths
        in 2004 and the health cost study 2018 found the number more than double (nearly
        126,000) which were 13.5% of all cause of deaths. According to Tobacco Atlas 2020,
        total death was recorded as 161,253.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.8. Data on the Socio-economic Burdens of Tobacco Use in Bangladesh
      </h4>
      <p>
        Total Health cost attributable to tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke was
        estimated to be approximately 305.7 billion BDT according to the Health Cost Study
        2018 (The Economic Cost of Tobacco Use in Bangladesh: A Health Cost Approach
        2020) 12 equivalent to 1.4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Bangladesh. In the
        table-1 below the increasing trend of cost attributable to tobacco use has been shown.
        Comparing with 2004 figure, it is found that total cost of tobacco related illness (both
        indirect and direct) has been more than double.
      </p>

      <p>
        Figure- 3 below shows that the cost of health care for tobacco related illness has
        increased 125% from 2004 to 2018. The report of 2018 also revealed that after
        adjustment of inflation, total economic cost of deaths and disabilities due to tobacco
        related diseases was found to be also more than double. Therefore, the burden on the
        economy of the tobacco users and the society is heavy and requires urgent action to
        reduce tobacco use.

      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.9. The myth of Contribution of tobacco industries to the national
      </h4>
      <p>
        According to health cost study 2018, the figure of revenue income from tobacco tax in
        the 2016-2017 fiscal year was 228.1 billion Taka while the cost of tobacco-induced
        illness, deaths and disabilities as a burden on Bangladesh’s economy was 305 billion
        Taka (USD 3.6 billion). 13 Therefore, the tobacco industries’ contribution to the economy
        cannot be defended positively as the cost and burden of illness, death, and disabilities
        due to tobacco use are much higher than the revenue income of the government of
        Bangladesh from tobacco industries. Therefore, the claim of the tobacco industries that
        they are contributing to the national economy is a myth.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-left:30px;color:#135C51">1.10. Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Studies have shown that prevalence of tobacco use has declined significantly in
        Bangladesh but still high in South East Asia Region. It is highly alarming that though the
        tobacco use has been on the declining trend but the deaths are recorded as double over
        the 14 years (2004-2018) period due to tobacco use in addition to tobacco related
        Non-communicable diseases (NCD). The number of children and adults are suffering
        due to exposure to SHS is also alarmingly high. Therefore, it is earnestly necessary for
        Bangladesh to go for comprehensive approach for rigorous tobacco control as well as to
        fulfill the Prime Minister’s commitment for making Bangladesh tobacco-free by 2040.

      <h2>2. History and Development of Tobacco Control Laws of Bangladesh</h2>
      <h4 class="intro">2.1. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Tobacco control provisions in legislation started with smoking control provisions in the
        Railways Act of 1890 (in the then British India) where a passenger, if continued to
        smoke after a warning, would be subject to a fine of Taka 20 and the railway employee
        could remove the passenger from the train compartment, which still exists in the Act
        (section 110 of Railways Act 1890). Although smoking control provisions were included
        in several legislations in different times 14 , a comprehensive tobacco control law was
        enacted in 2005 - The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control) Act 2005.
        This followed Bangladesh signing (2003) and ratifying (2004) the WHO FCTC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control) Rules were framed in 2006 for
        implementation of the Act. In 2013, the Act was amended to make it more compliant
        with FCTC. After the amendment of the Act in 2013, the Rules of 2006 were replaced
        with the Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control) Rules 2015 to make it
        updated according to the provisions of the amendments.
      </p>
      <p>
        After introduction of the Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control) Act 2005,
        the tobacco control issue gained momentum in Bangladesh which is why it is evident in
        the GATS Report 2017 that tobacco use is in decreasing trend since the GATS Report of
        2009 (43.3% in 2009 and 35.3% in 2017. The relative decline is 18.5%).
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">2.2. Some inconsistent provisions relating to tobacco control in
        different laws</h4>
      <p>
        There are inconsistencies in different laws relating to tobacco control, including the
        penalty and the status of cigarettes. For example, the penalty for smoking in public
        places and public transports in the Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (Control)
        Act, 2005 is up to Taka 300, which is Taka 20 in the Railways Act, up to Taka 100 in
        Metropolitan Police Ordinances and up to Taka 300 in the Metropolitan Police Acts.
        Cigarette is still listed as an essential commodity under the Control of Essential
        Commodities Act 1956.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">2.3. Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        The Smoking and Usage of Tobacco Products (control) Act 2005 got updated in 2013 to
        make it more compliant with FCTC provisions. However, there remains room for
        significant improvement as Bangladesh is still not fully compliant with its obligations
        under the WHO FCTC. At the same time the inconsistencies mentioned above need to
        be removed and uniform penal provision should be made for the same offence.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>3. Relevant Provisions of the Constitution</h2>
      <h4 class="intro">3.1. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Some provisions provide a mandate for the government to protect and improve public
        health and the environment. Tobacco use is mainly responsible for NCDs, resulting in
        colossal cost on medical care borne by the public and the government. The constitutional
        provisions are an obligation upon the government to take appropriate measures to
        protect citizens from deaths and diseases.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.2. Medical Care: A Basic Necessity</h4>
      <p>There are provisions in the Constitution of Bangladesh 15 that recognize medical care as
        a basic necessity. In providing medical care, the state has to endeavor to prevent citizens’
        diseases by taking appropriate measures. Control of tobacco use is thus a task for the
        government since tobacco use is a significant cause of NCDs. In part II of the
        Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh under the heading “Fundamental
        Principles of State Policy” it has been mentioned as follows:</p>
      <h4>Provision of Basic Necessities</h4>
      <p>Article 15. It shall be a fundamental responsibility of the State to attain, through
        planned economic growth, a constant increase of productive forces and a steady
        improvement in the material and cultural standard of living of the people, with a
        view to securing to its citizens –</p>
      <p>
        (a) the provision of the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, shelter,
        education and medical care;
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.3. Improvement of Health- A Primary Duty of the State</h4>
      <p>
        The constitution also provides directives to the state regarding public health
        improvement as one of its primary duties. Hence, the control of the use of an injurious
        product like tobacco is a government's constitutional obligation.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.4. Public Health and Morality</h4>
      <p>
        Article 18. (1) The State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the
        Improvement of public health as among its primary duties, and in particular shall
        adopt effective measures to prevent the consumption, except for medical purposes
        or for such other purposes as may be prescribed by law, of alcoholic and other
        intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.5. Protection and Improvement of Environment</h4>
      <p>
        The constitution has provided provisions for the protection and improvement of the
        environment and biodiversity. This is related to tobacco control since tobacco
        production and processing produce greenhouse gases and endangers the environment.
        Therefore, the government must contain environmental pollution created from tobacco
        production and processing.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.6. Protection and Improvement of Environment and Biodiversity</h4>
      <p>
        Article 18A. The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and
        to preserve and safeguard the natural resources, bio-diversity, wetlands, forests
        and wild life for the present and future citizens.
      </p>
      <h4 class="intro">3.7. Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        The constitution requires the country to undertake appropriate tobacco control measures
        to protect its people from tobacco harms, including illness, deaths, disability and
        medical care cost.

      <h2 class=" text-center" style="color:red">PART II</h2>
      <h3 class="text-center color-blue" style="color:#135C51">International Scenario & Best Practices on Tobacco
        Control Legislations </h3>
        <h3 class="color-blue" style="color:#135C51">4. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO
FCTC) is the first coordinated global effort to reduce tobacco use. The WHO FCTC
entered into force on February 27, 2005 and requires Parties to implement
evidence-based measures to reduce tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. When
effectively implemented, the WHO FCTC is a fundamental tool to reduce the
devastating global consequences of tobacco products on health, lives, economies and
environments. With 182 Parties as of May 2020, the WHO FCTC is one of the most
widely adopted treaties in the United Nations system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bangladesh was one of the founding Parties to the treaty, signing it on 16 Jun 2003 and
ratifying it on 14 June 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WHO FCTC contains a broad framework of obligations and rights and requires
Parties to implement effective tobacco control measures covering a range of topics.
Parties are encouraged to implement measures beyond those required by the WHO
FCTC (Art. 2.1). To date, Parties to the FCTC have adopted implementing Guidelines
for several Treaty Articles listed below and adopted the Protocol on Illicit Trade in
Tobacco Products to increase international cooperation to fight tobacco smuggling and
better control the legal tobacco trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adopted by consensus, the Guidelines to the FCTC were developed to assist Parties to
meet their FCTC legal obligations. The Guidelines contain principles, definitions, and
key legislative elements the Parties have agreed are necessary to provide effective
implementation of the treaty. To perform their treaty obligations in good faith, as
required by Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Parties must
take the FCTC Guidelines into account when determining the content and scope of their
FCTC obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bangladesh has made significant progress in implementing the treaty; however, this
progress has been uneven across different policy areas. This section’s purpose is to
provide a summary and overview of the relevant Articles of the WHO FCTC to help
ensure that country laws are compliant with the treaty and its Guidelines for
Implementation and reflect global best practice.
