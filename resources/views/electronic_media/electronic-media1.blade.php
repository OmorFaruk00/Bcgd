        The survey period was from 19 December 2017 to 18 March 2018 total 8 districts from 8 division was covered for the study. Total 491 tobacco pack (Cigarette -184, Bidi -21,  Zordha- 260 , and Gul- 26 ) was analyzed. Both qualitative and quantitative technique was used for conducting the study. Section 10 of Tobacco Control Law was considered to develop the research question and a semi- structure questionnaire was developed to collect the primary data.   The survey report shows that 81% tobacco pack implement the GHWs among these 61% was covered 50% principal display area but poor implementation among Zordha 39% and Gul 38%. The image of GHWs must change in every three months as per law but the research found only 64% tobacco pack used current rotation image on the time of research. Research found very poor implementation regarding GHWs print both side of the tobacco pack and it was only 42% among these Cigarette 99%, Bidi 11%,  Zordha 11%, and Gul was 14%. Over all GHWs implementation is 81% among these 5% was foreign image, 10% was unclear, 10% covered by band roll, 100% carton was not implement the GHWs. As per tobacco control law section 10 subsection 3 that “Permitted to sales only in Bangladesh” must print on the tobacco packs for selling the tobacco products in Bangladesh but 68% tobacco pack was not print this title on their packets.

        If we consider all the elements of section10 of Tobacco Control Law then the implementation rate is very poor that is only 20% (Cigarette 74%, Bidi 0%,  Zordha 5%, and Gul was 0%) almost all the tobacco company violate the law by different ways on the provisions of section 10 of Tobacco Control Law in Bangladesh.
