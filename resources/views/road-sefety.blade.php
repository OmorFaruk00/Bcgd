            The roundtable meeting shed light on the urgent need for a comprehensive road safety law in Bangladesh. The speakers emphasized the importance of a legal framework that incorporates the Safe System Approach and addresses various aspects of road safety. It is evident that ensuring road safety is a collective responsibility, and the enactment of a comprehensive road safety law will provide the legal basis for all relevant government departments and ministries to take effective actions to reduce road accidents and casualties in the country.

          <p style="text-align:justify">
            This report highlights the consensus among experts and stakeholders that the current legislation is insufficient to address the complex challenges of road safety, and a dedicated legal framework is crucial for achieving safer roads in Bangladesh.
