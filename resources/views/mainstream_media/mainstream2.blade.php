        Dhaka, August 20, 2023 (BASS): Bangladesh National Parliament Deputy Speaker Md. Shamsul Haque Tuku said that smoking, whether through e-cigarettes or bidis and cigarettes, is always harmful to the human body. E-cigarettes and tobacco are destroying the youth.

        The Deputy Speaker said these things in the chief guest’s speech at the round table meeting titled ‘E-Cigarette: Myth and Reality’ at the Parliament Members Club of Jatiya Sangsad Bhavan today.

        President of the Standing Committee on the Ministry of Science and Technology. F. M. Ruhul Haque participated in the event virtually. Besides, Barrister Shamim Haider Patwari, Rana Mohammad Sohail, Md. Nurul Islam Talukder and Adiba Anjum Mita participated in the round table meeting.

        Shamsul Haque Tuku also said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wants to make the country tobacco and drug free by 2041. To implement this goal, it is very important to strengthen the tobacco and smoking prevention laws. In order for a non-smoker to prohibit a smoker from smoking in front of him, the non-smoker must have a legal basis for the prohibition. I would very much like the anti-tobacco law to come in a revised form.

        Shamsul Haque Tuku also said, why young people are getting addicted to e-cigarettes and smoking, these places should be identified and remedies should be found. He also said that the harmful aspects of drugs and tobacco should be regularly discussed in religious institutions.

        Additional Secretary of Health Services Department, Md. Saidur Rahman, Ekatar TV senior journalist Sushant Sinha and Sharebiz journalist Masum Billah and representatives of various organizations and media workers were present in the event.
